2. .bat file is not created because then the viewer would have to edit this file also, so To keep it simple and not to get into complications there is only one file to run.
3. Now Viewer have to edit only one file and add path/location as recommended in the rules.
4. Viewver can run any of the one file either by IDLE or .exe anyway which is convenient by following measures.
