# Sada
1. To keep it simple so that viewer can run a single file, there is only one file profitvalue.py to run from idle(recommended), 
2. No .bat file is created, as the viewer need to add path or location for the files.
3. Tested on python IDLE Shell 3.9.7
# Measures: before running the file:
1. Download data.csv from https://gist.github.com/bobbae/b4eec5b5cb0263e7e3e63a6806d045f2 as "raw" or you can also download from the repository.
2. Open profitvalue.py in Idle
3. Insert the location in line 3 where you have saved your data.csv
4. Insert the location in line 4 where you want to save data2.json
5. Click run or press f5
6. Click ok to save
